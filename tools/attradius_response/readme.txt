File(s): attradius_lin.cpp
Description: C++ routine which calculates the attraction radius according to the MagChain model, according to particle properties.

Files generated:

1) A two-column file with a 1-line header (attradius.dat).
first column: number of beads in the chain-like aggregate.
second column: value of the attraction radius in particle diameters.

2) log file with the input parameters used (log.txt).

3) response.txt : a file with the magnetic response (dipole of a particle as a function of applied magnetic field)
