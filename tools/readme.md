# Attraction radius file generator
C++ program to prepare the "interaction radius" input file for the MagChain simulation.
These programs generate the interaction data needed during the actual simulation.

We include here programs for two different approximations: a fixed dipole for the partices and a response of the particles that depends on the applied field.

# MagChain Editor
C++ program with graphical interface in Qt4 to generate the input files needed by MagChain.

# MagChain Analysis
Python analysis tool for MagChain output files with a PyQt5 graphical interface implemented.

# MagChain Simulator
Python graphical interface to run the simulation in a simply and intuitive way.
