README.examples for MagChain 24Nov2011 package.

This folder contains 4 different examples on simulations corresponding to the
different modes available in the MagChain program. The input scripts
provided in these examples can be used as templates for your own simulations.

* new-equil: Performs an equilibration run of a system with particles,
  starting from an initial configuration where the particles positions have been
  initialized at random.

* new-prod: Performs an production run of the system with particles,
  starting from an  initial configuration where the particles positions have been
  initialized at random.

* restart-equil: restarts a previous simulation configuration (restart file:
  restart.data) in equilibration mode.

* restart-prod: restarts a previous simulation configuration (restart file:
  restart.data) in production mode.
