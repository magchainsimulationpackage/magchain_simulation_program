ACADEMIC LICENCE for INDIVIDUALS

Motivation and Preamble

The MAGCHAIN program has been devised for use in academic research within the academic 
community. Some conditions have been defined for the use, distribution, and modification of the 
program, which the authors consider fair and within the common fair practices in the academic 
community.

Individuals in companies or industry, including also spin-off or start-up companies and members of the 
academic community acting as consultants for private companies, are not allowed to employ the 
MAGCHAIN package under this Academic License. However, they are encouraged to contact the 
authors of the package and obtain a specific agreement for their specific use of the MAGCHAIN 
package.

1. Definitions

"The Authors" are:

    * Jordi S. Andreu, ICMAB-CSIC and Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona
    * Carles Calero, ICMAB-CSIC and Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona
    * Juan Camacho, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona
    * Jordi Faraudo, ICMAB-CSIC, Barcelona

"The Copyright-Holders" are:

    * Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB)
    * Agencia Estatal Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC)

The valid distributors of the MAGCHAIN package ("The Distributors") are the authors, and Copyright-
Holders as specified above.

"The MAGCHAIN package" is the suite of software, including the MAGCHAIN code itself, but also 
all other software, documentation, scripts, and ancillary support material. The MAGCHAIN package is 
distributed as a single entity. This License covers the entirety of said data.

The Licensee is the person (never an institution) to whom the MAGCHAIN package is distributed 
(under the terms of this Licence) by the Distributors; they are bound by this agreement.

2. NO WARRANTY

There is no warranty for any part of the MAGCHAIN package. The MAGCHAIN package is provided 
by the Distributors "as-is" without warranty of any kind, either as expressed or implied, including but 
not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. In no event 
shall the Distributors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential 
damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or 
profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, 
strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this 
software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage. The entire risk as to the quality or 
performance of the program, or any action the Licensee may take based on the output of any part of the 
MAGCHAIN package, is with the Licensee.

3. Limitation of Usage

The use of the MAGCHAIN package under the present Licence is restricted solely to individuals 
working in academic institutions (including universities and non-military public research laboratories) 
and for academic purposes, i.e., leading to open publication of results, with neither withhold of 
information nor intentional delay in publication. The use of the MAGCHAIN code in start-up or spin-
off companies or any other kind of companies with links of any nature to the academic community is 
not allowed by the present License. 

Notwithstanding these general definitions, the Authors reserve the exclusive right to determine what 
purposes and institutions are eligible for using the MAGCHAIN package under this Licence, and to 
withhold the right to use the software where they are not satisfied that either condition is fulfilled.

The Licensee is hereby provided with a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to use any part of the 
MAGCHAIN package. The displaying, publishing, performing, or otherwise using of results obtained 
by use of the MAGCHAIN package in any form is subject to the restriction that in any paper or other 
academic publication containing results wholly or partially derived from the results of use of the 
MAGCHAIN package, the following paper must be cited in the normal manner:

"On-the-fly coarse-graining methodology for the simulation of chain formation of              
superparamagnetic colloids in strong magnetic fields" by Jordi S. Andreu, Carles Calero, Juan 
Camacho and Jordi Faraudo, arXiv:1111.5784 [cond-mat.soft].

Other papers relevant to the MAGCHAIN package and method should be cited as best scientific 
practice dictates.

Licensees are recommended to send reference to the Authors of any publication containing results 
wholly or partially derived from the results of use of the MAGCHAIN package.

The above-mentioned right to use the code is extensive to the members of the research group of the 
Licensee as long as the use is in collaboration with the Licensee leading to co-authored publication(s).

4. Support

The present License does not imply support services of any kind to the Licensee by the Distributors, 
including, but not limited to, installation, compilation and use of the software in the package.

5. Modification

Licensees are permitted to modify MAGCHAIN for their own privative use; in any paper containing 
results wholly or partially derived from the use of a modified version of MAGCHAIN, the authors are 
required to state that a privately modified version of MAGCHAIN is used, and satisfy the conditions of 
use stated above.

The Authors encourage Licensees to submit their modifications of the MAGCHAIN package to them, 
so that the MAGCHAIN package can be improved for all users. Licensees can thereby benefit from the 
ulterior developments of MAGCHAIN.

To this end, the Authors wish to encourage Licensees to make modifications to the MAGCHAIN 
package but always maintaining its structure. This permits maintenance of these modifications as a 
separate entity in many cases, and may allow their separation from MAGCHAIN and distribution as a 
separate piece of software: in that case, such software is not subject to this Licence, and the authors of 
the separate software are free to choose any licensing terms they desire.

However, if a given modification must be incorporated directly into the MAGCHAIN package (this 
will be a "Contributed Code"), the author(s) of any such modifications must provide a perpetual, 
royalty-free, irrevocable license to the Authors and the Copyright-Holder, to further modify their 
Contributed Code as may prove necessary for the future development of MAGCHAIN, and to 
distribute the Contributed Code (in its original or any later modified form) as part of the MAGCHAIN 
package.

6. Redistribution

The authors reserve the exclusive right to distribute the MAGCHAIN package. Licensees have no right 
to distribute the MAGCHAIN package, a modified or alternative version thereof, or any other program 
making direct use of parts of the MAGCHAIN package, without the prior written consent of the 
Authors.

7. All Other Rights

All other rights not explicitly mentioned in this document are reserved. In particular, the Authors 
reserve for themselves all rights to resolve any and all conflicts arising in the development and 
distribution policies of the MAGCHAIN package.
